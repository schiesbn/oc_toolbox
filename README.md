# oc_toolbox

This repository contain some small scripts I use during my daily work on
ownCloud. I don't put many efforts in making them generic. The main purpose of
the scripts is to assist me during my work. Feel free to use it but don't be
surprised if you need to adjust some paths, etc in order to make it work in
your environment.
